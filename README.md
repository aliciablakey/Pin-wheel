Tiny Trotters

A digital spin on an old-fashioned toy. Push toys are meant to help children and encourage them to walk more by offering a fun interaction.  Tiny Trotters is an interactive push toy with a light up pixel indicator in the wheel. When the toy is around others it becomes a game instilling togetherness. Like a stop light when walking at night Tiny Trotters can be used in unison when together they are green; if they havenâ€™t connected in a short period of time the toys turn yellow then red to indicate to go back. If veering away from each other the red indication and bright LED and can be considered a safety feature for children that wander off as well.
